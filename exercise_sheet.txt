Please write a simple HTTP web service that provides a RESTful API to determine if a word is "misspelled" or not.  If it is, give some spelling suggestions.

* For this exercise, misspelled words are:
    A. Words that have repeating characters (ie: balllooooon)
    B. Words that are missing one or more vowels (ie: balln)
    C. Words with mixed-casing (ie: BAllOOn) - Note: "Hello" and "HELLO" are correct and should not be considered mixed-casing
    D. Words that have a combination of A, B and C type erroes (ie: BlllLLlln)
* Use http://tinyurl.com/bvapsn7 as your dictionary of words.
* The endpoint of the service should be /spelling/$word
    * Please use 8080 as default port for the service (ie: we should be able to test the service with "curl http://localhost:8080/spelling/House")
* The service needs to return:
    * 404 if the word was not found in the dictionary
    * 200 if the word was found.  The body of the response should be JSON encoded and should inform the caller if the spelling of $word is correct.  If it is not, it should contain a list of suggestions for possible correct spellings.

Examples:
    URL: http://localhost:8080/spelling/Balloon
    Response code: 200
    Response body:
    { correct: true }

    URL: http://localhost:8080/spelling/BallloN
    Response code: 200
    Response body:
    {
        correct: false,
        suggestions: ["abalone", "balloon"]
    }

    URL: http://localhost:8080/spelling/fsiuyflusyifys
    Response code: 404

    URL: http://localhost:8080/spelling/dua
    Response code: 404
